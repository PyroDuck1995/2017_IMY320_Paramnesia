---CSS---
- Sort out center black block
- Add mustard block behind black block (mustard colour can be found on the .psd file)
- Modify the menu so that it is visible at all times when scrolling down. Ie, it stays static and the rest of the page moves.

---JS---(mercy be upon you)
- Add and implement the cursor symbols. When going up the symbol should become larger. Same for going down.
- Make all the pages' backgrounds flicker slightly as if the light in the scene is wonky.
- ??Buffering symbol & page??
